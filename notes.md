CURRENTLY WORKING ON:
make edit page match new.erb formatting

STILL NOT WORKING
- for entries/:id and entries/:id/edit -- working on controlling so a user can't manually
    enter a entry that doesn't exist or has been deleted to avoid an active record error.
    need a case for them being logged_in and when they are not logged in

- ADD TIME in 12 hour format to entry show page
layout, css, page checks and indentations
- make edit entry page identical to create new entry page
  - add "cancel edit" to edit entry page
  - add "nevermind, back to dashboard" to new page

- Add insights to dashboard
  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10fACQt8WISQdE05fCdGxgw2hNDabY0VMoQ8KCccCRAg/edit#gid=0

COMPLETED: index, signup, dashboard, entries all show, create new entry

- HTML validations
- new and edit seem to be working
    - test if they can work without the validations in the models
        VS.
    - test to see if they work without the if !mood.empty? etc statement
https://apidock.com/rails/ActionView/Helpers/FormOptionsHelper/select

or can try the bug fix from the pets/owners complex forms lab

REFACTOR:
- EXTRACT the new/edit find or create by mood and activity iterations into HELPER METHODS to call!!

UP NEXT:
- Make sure a user can only access their own content
- Navigation between pages / option to logout often
- Layout fun!
- Add insights: any data summaries? X moods over last 30 days. most done activities, etc?

REACH GOALS:
- Add Sinatra Flash
- Add JQuery Chosen gem (can it be used in sinata)? for moods selector list
