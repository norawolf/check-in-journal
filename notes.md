- Can Scraper inherit from ActiveRecord base?


UP NEXT:

- Add scraper for moods to seeds.rb
- Then, seed database with a few activities and moods
- Build "create a new entry" form


Reach Goals:

entry1 = Entry.new(date: "today", note: "test", user_id: 1)
  => #<Entry id: nil, date: "today", note: "test", user_id: 1, created_at: nil, updated_at: nil>


activities = ["run", "meditate", "work"]
  => ["run", "meditate", "work"]

# options to expand, to allow moods to have :severity and
# activities to have a :duration

  moods.each do |mood|
    entry1.moods << Mood.find_or_create_by(name: mood)
  end

  activities.each do |activity|
    entry1.activities << Activity.find_or_create_by(name: activity)
  end

entry1.save   # at end, in case of
